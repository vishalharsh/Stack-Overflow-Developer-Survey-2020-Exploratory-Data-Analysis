## Exploratory Data Analytics of Stack Overflow Survey 2020

![Stack Overflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0dust/Stack-Overflow-Developer-Survey/master/stack-overflow.png)

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis of Stack OverFlow Survey 2020 data using Python and libraries to generate useful insights.

– Built a database from data present on official site of Stack OverFlow,(https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020)

– Queried on various parameters like most used, most preferred programming language and Demographics of the users all around the globe.

– Made report using Python Libraries (Numpy,Pandas,MatPlotLib and Seaborn)on JuyPter Notebook.


## Description on the dataset:

The enclosed data set is the full, cleaned results of the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Free response submissions and personally identifying information have been removed from the results to protect the privacy of respondents. There are three files besides this README:

1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
3. so_survey_2020.pdf - PDF file of survey instrument



## Inferences and Conclusions¶

We've drawn many inferences from the survey. Here's a summary of a few of them:

Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries and women & non-binary genders.

The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although things are improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.

Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.

A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.

Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.

Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.

Rust and TypeScript are the most "loved" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.

Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.

You can learn and start programming professionally at any age. You're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.
