![Stack Overflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0dust/Stack-Overflow-Developer-Survey/master/stack-overflow.png)

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis of Stack OverFlow Survey 2020 data using Python and libraries to generate useful insights.

– Built a database from data present on official site of Stack OverFlow,(https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020)

– Queried on various parameters like most used, most preferred programming language and Demographics of the users all around the globe.

– Made report using Python Libraries (Numpy,Pandas,MatPlotLib and Seaborn)on JuyPter Notebook.

## Inferences and Conclusions¶

We've drawn many inferences from the survey. Here's a summary of a few of them:

Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries and women & non-binary genders.

The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although things are improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.

Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.

A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.

Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.

Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.

Rust and TypeScript are the most "loved" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.

Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.

You can learn and start programming professionally at any age. You're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.
